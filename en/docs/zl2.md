# Zalith Launcher 2

**Zalith Launcher 2** is a newly designed launcher for **Android devices** running [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/).  
The project is based on the native launch logic of [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/tree/v3_openjdk/app_pojavlauncher/src/main/jni) and built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design 3** to create a modern UI experience.

## 🌐 Language and Translation Support

Zalith Launcher 2 currently provides support for the following two languages:

* **English** (default)  
* **Simplified Chinese**  

These two languages are **officially maintained and guaranteed complete** by Zalith Launcher 2.  
Community contributions for other languages are welcome, but please note the following:

### 📌 Why only English and Simplified Chinese?

* Zalith Launcher 2 targets a **global user base**, so English is the default interface language. However, since the developer is not a native English speaker, English translations rely heavily on AI assistance and may contain minor inaccuracies.  
* The developer [@MovTery](https://github.com/MovTery) is Chinese and ensures the quality and completeness of the **Simplified Chinese** translation.  
* Due to limited manpower, the completeness of other language translations cannot be guaranteed and depends on community contributions.

### ✍️ How to participate in translations?

If you want to add support for your native language in Zalith Launcher 2, please submit translation files via Pull Requests. See details here:

We plan to open a Weblate project in the future to make it easier for translators to contribute!
