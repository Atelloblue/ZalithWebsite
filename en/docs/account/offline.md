# Offline Account

### What is an Offline Account?
An offline account is a locally simulated Minecraft account that bypasses official verification. It is typically used by non-official players or in specific server environments. Essentially, it's a "pseudo-official account" simulated through third-party launchers or server configurations, **without legitimate authorization**.

### Bypassing Official Verification Mechanism and Implementation
- When the server setting `online-mode=false`, the Minecraft client **will not connect to Mojang servers for account validation**.
- Players can input any username (e.g., `Player123`), and the client will generate a **random UUID** (virtual identity identifier) and log in to the game.
- This account exists only in the local or LAN environment, with no data interaction with official servers.

- **Third-party Launchers (e.g., HMCL, PCL2)**: Provide an "Offline Mode" option, allowing players to create local accounts.
- **Servers**: When configured with `online-mode=false`, servers allow players to connect using offline accounts.

### Uses
1. Free access to all vanilla gameplay modes in single-player mode.
2. Play on certain special servers:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Public Welfare Servers | To lower player barriers (e.g., student groups), they actively disable official verification (such as small domestic RPG, survival, or multiplayer servers). |
| Local Network Multiplayer | LAN-based multiplayer without internet verification (requires mod support).

3. Customization Flexibility
- **Local Skin & Cape Loading**: Directly load local skin & cape files through the launcher (no need for the official skin system).
- **Free Username Switching**: Change to any ID upon each login (official requires a 30-day cooldown period).

::: danger Warning
Using offline accounts for multiplayer gaming has the following risks:
- **Account Impersonation**: Any player can enter the server with the same username (e.g., `Notch`), making real identity verification impossible.
- **Account Theft Vulnerability**: Offline servers lack password verification mechanisms; others can "log in as you" simply by using your ID.
- **Cheating Proliferation**: Cheaters cannot be tracked via UUID (the same player can change IDs infinitely to evade bans).

### Comparison with Official Accounts

| Comparison | **Offline Account** | **Official Account** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Legality** | ‚ùå Unauthorized, violates EULA | ‚úÖ Officially Authorized |
| **Identity Uniqueness** | ‚ùå Randomly generated UUID, can be duplicated | ‚úÖ Bound to a unique UUID |
| **Multiplayer Server Compatibility** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to offline servers only | ‚úÖ Supports all official/online servers |
| **Long-term Stability** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on third-party tools, updates may be interrupted | ‚úÖ Official continuous maintenance |

Although the NetEase version is considered official, its account system is independent from the international version, fundamentally different from offline accounts (login via NetEase account, but functionality is similarly restricted).
