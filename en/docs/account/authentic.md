# Official Account

### What is an Official Account?
A Minecraft official account (also known as a Mojang or Microsoft account) refers to a game-authorized account that is purchased and activated through official channels.

### Authorization Mechanism
The concept of "official" in Minecraft revolves around the "account" rather than the game itself. Players need to purchase the game (the Java & Bedrock bundle package costs 89 yuan) on the official website (minecraft.net) and activate it to obtain a uniquely bound official account. The game client can be downloaded for free, but without an official account, full functionality cannot be accessed.

::: warning Note
Purchase must be done through the official website or authorized platforms (such as Xbox or Microsoft Store) to avoid the risk of "black card" accounts.

### Uses
- **Access to complete official services**: This includes features like customizing skins, wearing capes, and changing usernames, all supported by official servers.
- **Cross-platform synchronization**: Official accounts can be used across PC (Java/Bedrock editions), consoles, mobile devices, etc., with data such as saves and skin information synchronized across devices.
- **Online Servers (online-mode)**: Large international servers (e.g., Hypixel, 2b2t) enforce "official account verification", allowing only officially licensed accounts to enter. These servers typically offer rich gameplay experiences and timely updates.

Although the NetEase version is also considered official, due to its closed ecosystem, it significantly lags behind the international official version in terms of mod flexibility and international community connectivity.
