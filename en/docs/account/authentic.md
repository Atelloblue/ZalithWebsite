# Official Account

### What is an Official Account?
An **official Minecraft account** (also known as a Mojang or Microsoft account) is a fully authorized account purchased and activated through official channels.  

### Authorization Mechanism
The "official" status applies to the **account** rather than the game itself. Players must purchase Minecraft (Java & Bedrock bundle costs $30 USD, $41 CAD $24 GBP) on the **official website** ([minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net)) or through authorized platforms like **Xbox** or **Microsoft Store**. Once activated, the account is uniquely bound to the player.  

While the game client can be downloaded for free, **full access to all game features requires an official account**.  

::: warning Note
Purchases must be made through the official website or authorized platforms to avoid the risk of "black card" accounts.

### Uses
- **Full access to official features**: Customize skins, wear capes, and change usernames, all supported on official servers.  
- **Cross-platform synchronization**: Use the same account across PC (Java/Bedrock), consoles, and mobile devices, with data such as saves and skins synced across devices.  
- **Access to online servers (online-mode)**: Large international servers (e.g., Hypixel, 2b2t) enforce official account verification, allowing only licensed accounts to join. These servers offer rich gameplay and frequent updates.  

::: tip ðŸ’¡ Tip
Although the **NetEase version** is also official, its closed ecosystem limits mod flexibility and connection to the international Minecraft community.
